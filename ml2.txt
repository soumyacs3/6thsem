 PROGRAM 2 
Develop a program to Compute the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between pairs of 
features. Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to know which variables have strong 
positive/negative correlations. Create a pair plot to visualize pairwise relationships between features. 
Use California Housing dataset.  
 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing 
# Step 1: Load the California Housing dataset 
california_housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True) 
df = california_housing.frame 
# Step 2: Compute the correlation matrix 
correlation_matrix = df.corr() 
# Step 3: Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap 
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) 
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5) 
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Features') 
plt.show() 
# Step 4: Create a pair plot to visualize pairwise relationships between features 
# For better visualization, we will use a subset of the data (e.g., first 5 features) 
subset_features = df.columns[:5]  # Using the first 5 features for better clarity in the pair plot 
sns.pairplot(df[subset_features], hue=None, plot_kws={'alpha': 0.7}) 
plt.suptitle('Pair Plot of Selected Features', y=1.02) 
plt.show()
